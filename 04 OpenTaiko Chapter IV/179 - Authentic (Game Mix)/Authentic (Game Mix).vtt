WEBVTT Offset: 0;

00:14.211 --> 00:17.368
I’m tied down by unreachable expectations,

00:17.368 --> 00:20.526
you call me a faker 'cause I’m that much realer.

00:20.526 --> 00:23.684
“Relearn from me!”, you say, but I go my own way.

00:23.684 --> 00:26.842
So don’t drag me into this broken brand-new age.

00:26.842 --> 00:30.000
When the ship goes down, don’t expect me to drown.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.158
I’ll find my own way to make my great escape!

00:33.158 --> 00:36.711
Don’t paint me the villain, 'cause you’re not winnin’.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.092
I’m not gonna lie down and take it,

00:38.092 --> 00:39.474
but you’re gonna wanna save this:

00:39.474 --> 00:42.829
All those shining lights on you, it’s not easy to do.

00:42.829 --> 00:44.112
Life under constant supervision,

00:44.112 --> 00:45.789
they say it’s all wrong!

00:45.987 --> 00:47.368
But I’m not gonna fake it,

00:47.566 --> 00:48.947
yeah, now I’m gonna make it.

00:49.145 --> 00:52.105
Throw all that doubt away and make a new sound!

00:53.289 --> 00:55.263
Shout like there’s no tomorrow!

00:55.461 --> 00:56.842
Don’t let your feelings go!

00:57.039 --> 00:58.421
Listen to the sound

00:58.618 --> 01:00.000
that only you can make!

01:01.579 --> 01:01.776
Love all that is yours,

01:03.158 --> 01:03.355
the good, bad, and the ugly!

01:04.934 --> 01:06.316
Don’t fear the unknown,

01:06.513 --> 01:07.895
just run straight into it!

01:08.092 --> 01:09.474
There’s just no need to fight it,

01:09.671 --> 01:11.053
or need to stay divided.

01:11.053 --> 01:12.632
Listen to that burning fire

01:12.829 --> 01:14.211
deep inside your heart!

01:14.408 --> 01:15.789
Run for that shiny future,

01:15.987 --> 01:17.368
don’t give up like a loser!

01:17.368 --> 01:18.947
Hold tight what you think is right and

01:18.947 --> 01:45.395
chase that dream some more!

01:47.368 --> 01:47.566
Shout like there’s no tomorrow!

01:48.947 --> 01:50.526
Don’t let your feelings go!

01:50.724 --> 01:52.105
Listen to the sound

01:53.684 --> 01:53.882
that only you can make!

01:55.263 --> 01:55.461
Love all that is yours,

01:57.039 --> 01:58.421
the good, bad, and the ugly!

01:58.618 --> 02:00.000
Don’t fear the unknown,

02:00.197 --> 02:01.579
just run straight into it!

02:01.776 --> 02:03.158
There’s just no need to fight it,

02:04.737 --> 02:04.934
or need to stay divided.

02:06.316 --> 02:06.513
Listen to that burning fire

02:07.895 --> 02:08.092
deep inside your heart!

02:09.474 --> 02:11.053
Run for that shiny future,

02:11.053 --> 02:11.053
don’t give up like a loser!
